Updates on version 0.16.1
  # Simplified installation of the library

Updates on version 0.16
  # Major library rearrangement

Updates on version 0.15
  # Multilayer graphene module
  # Various optimizations

Updates on version 0.13
  # Bug fixes
  # New autoupdate feature in the main window

Updates on version 0.12
  # Added twisted bilayer graphene module
  # Generic optimizations


Updates on version 0.11
  # Ground state button only necessary when doing selfconsistent calculations
  # Interactive LDOS in 0d and 1d systems
  # Added moire module
  # Generic optimizations

Updates on version 0.10
  # Several bug fixes related with the migration from tb90.x to pure python


Updates on version 0.9
  # Minor bug fixes
  # Improved atom picking in huge islands
  # More estetic plots
  # Free supercell generation in 1d

Updates of the 0.8.1 version
  # Minor bug fixes


Updates of the 0.7.3 version
  # Removed dependency on the tb90.x program, now all the calculations
    are performed with the Python/f2py libraries. Note: tb90.x was the
    first tight binding program that I develop, that initially gave rise
    to an interface called graphene-like ribbons
  # Added "Save" button to all the modules, now input and output
    files will be saved in a local folder called QH_save
  # Added calculation of surface density of states in the 2d and multilayers
    module. This allows to observe the edge states in the case the bulk
    is topological



Updates of the 0.7.2 version
  # Added "current operator" in 1d bandstructure plot
  # Added 2d berry map in 2d module
  # The code is being adapted to not using the program tb90.x in the future,
    we expect to have removed that dependency in the near future
  # Several performance improvements


Updates of the 0.7 version
  # improved colossal islands module adding several new functionalities,
    we thank Ivan Brihuega for the suggestions

Updates of the 0.6.1 version
  # bug fixes and various optimizations

Updates of the 0.6 version
  # interfaces module

Updates of the 0.4.5 version
  # colossal islands module (beta version), using the kernel polynomial method
  # added Lieb lattice


Updates of the 0.4.4 version
  # minor bug fixes
  # esthetic improvements
  # python library improvement

Updates of the 0.4.3 version
  # minor bug fixes


Updates of the 0.4.2 version
  # Added multilayers mode
  # Improved and reorganized setup library
  # Improved memory management 


Updates of the 0.4.1 version
  # Added vacancies module
  # Improved library organization
